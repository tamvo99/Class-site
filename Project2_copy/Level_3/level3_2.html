        It was a long time ago, <br>
        I have almost forgotten my dream <br>
        but it was there then,<br>
        in front of me,<br>
        bright like a sun,<br>
        my dream <br>
        And then the wall rose, <br>
        rose slowly,<br>
        slowly,<br>
        between me and my dream. <br>
