    &nbsp;As <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp; I <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Grew <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Older <br>
   <br>
    by Langston Hughes <br>
    <br>

    It was a long time ago &nbsp; I have almost forgotten my dream <br>
    But it was there then, &nbsp; In front of me, <br>
    Bright like a sun- &nbsp; My dream, <br>
    And then the wall rose, &nbsp; Rose slowly, <br>
    Slow, &nbsp; Between <br>
    Me &nbsp; and my dream.
