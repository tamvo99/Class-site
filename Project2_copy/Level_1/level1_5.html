   As I Grew Older <br>
   <br>
   <br>
   by <br>
   Langston <br>

   <br>
   
   It was a long time ago <br> 
   I <br>
   Have <br>
   Almost <br>
   Forgotten <br>
   My <br>
   Dream <br>
   But it was there then, <br>
   In <br>
   Front <br>
   Of <br>
   Me <br>
   Bright like a sun- <br>
   My <br>
   Dream <br>
   And then the wall rose <br>
   Rose <br>
   Slowly, <br>
   Between <br>
   Me and my dream.
